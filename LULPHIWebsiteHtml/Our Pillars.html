        <P style="margin-left: 5%;">La Unidad Latina, Lambda Upsilon Lambda, Fraternity Inc. was established in 1982 by 13 men on a mission to combat inequities in their environment. The huge educational gap that existed within the Latino community was a primary concern.  As Cornell undergraduate students, the founding fathers overcame the shortcomings of their communities to gain entry to a top ranking university. Along their journey they observed the difficulties fellow classmates endured as they pursued success in higher education. It is from this experience La Unidad Latina   developed is academic ambitions.<br><br>
            ​
            In today’s society education allows us to reach the next level, builds our careers, and get us the best jobs.  Our academics is what helps us understand the world better and teaches us to stand up to all the challenges that life throws at us. The quality of our academics helps shape our overall personality, way of thinking, and our attitude towards life. As a result, we will forever be students as each day something new and exciting is learned.<br><br>
            ​
            Education is an important principle to La Unidad Latina, because its’ goal is and will forever be to unite and advance minorities to excel pass their comfort zone. Education was, is, and continues to be the most important principle to our Founding Fathers mission.</P>
