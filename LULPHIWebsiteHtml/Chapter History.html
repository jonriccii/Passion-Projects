        <h1>THE STORY OF PHI CHAPTER</h1>
        <p>During the summer of 1995, the initial interest was sparked to start a new fraternity at the University of Maryland, College Park. Our initial contact with perspective fraternities occurred when several of the interested men attended the Puerto Rican Day Parade in New York. However, La Unidad Latina stood out above all other fraternities in attendance. After conducting more research on the different fraternities in the U.S., the choice was made to pursue La Unidad Latina Lambda Upsilon Lambda Fraternity, Inc. Its positive history and presence at 24 quality universities in addition to the goals set forth by the fraternity to lead the Latino community, made it the obvious choice.<br> <br> 
            
        After more traveling and further networking, the interest was set in stone. In mid-summer of 1995, we officially became the interested men of Lambda Upsilon Lambda. During that time, we conducted fundraising activities and also became active as an organization by joining with 5 other Latino societies to form the Hispanic Heritage Month coalition which planned the first ever Hispanic Heritage Month celebration at the University of Maryland.<br> <br>
             
        All the hard work and dedication paid off as the Phi Colony was established in late September of that year. After going through a rigorous, educational, and rewarding in-take process, the Phi Chapter of La Unidad Latina, Lambda Upsilon Lambda Fraternity, Inc. was officially founded on December 10, 1995. We became the first Latino fraternity to establish its presence in the Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Area. The Phi Chapter has also been the focal point of expansion of La Unidad Latina into other institutions of higher learning such as Georgetown University, George Washington University, American University, George Mason University, University of Virginia, Virginia Commonwealth University, James Madison University, and John Hopkins University. Since then, Phi Chapter has had lines during the Fall 1996, Fall 1997, Fall 1998, Fall 1999, Fall 2000, Spring 2001, Spring 2003, Spring 2004, Fall 2004, Spring 2005, Spring 2006, Spring 2007, Spring 2008, Spring 2009, Spring 2010, Spring 2012, Spring 2014, Spring 2015, Spring 2016, Fall 2017, Spring 2019, Spring 2020, Spring 2021, and Spring 2022 semesters. Take a look at our Hermanos.<br> <br>
             
        La Unidad Latina Lambda Upsilon Lambda Fraternity, Inc. has been at the forefront addressing the issues that affect the Latino community. We, the Hermanos of Phi Chapter, at the University of Maryland, College Park are undoubtedly well on our way to upholding such a prestigious reputation. Para Siempre, Hermanos!</p>
